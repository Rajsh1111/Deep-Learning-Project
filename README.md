# Fungi Image Classification using Deep Learning Models

Traditionally, diagnosis and treatment of fungal infections in humans depend heavily on face-to-face consultations or examinations made by specialized laboratory scientists known as mycologists. In many cases, such as the recent mucormycosis spread in the COVID-19 pandemic, an initial treatment can be safely suggested to the patient during the earliest stage of the mycological diagnostic process by performing a direct examination of biopsies or samples through a microscope.
The project objective is to classify five fungi types using different convolutional neural network models like VGG16, VGG19, and ResNet50, the images donated by a mycological laboratory in Colombia has been used by medical research teams worldwide. These images were manually labelled into five classes and curated with subject matter expert assistance. The images were later cropped and modified with automated coding routines to produce the final dataset. The dataset being used for this project is available at: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/camilovu/lemm-raw. Our Project objective is to get experimental results by classifying five fungi types using different deep learning approaches like convolutional neural network models - VGG16, VGG19, ResNet50 in order to benchmark the classification performance using pre-trained models based on the ImageNet dataset.

Here are two research papers on Fungi image classification that will serve as reference for this project:
1.	Research article - Defungi: Direct mycological examination of microscopic fungi images (https://doi.org/10.58190/icat.2023.12)  provides a comprehensive review of experimental results classifying five fungi types.
2.	Classification of fungal genera from microscopic images using artificial intelligence (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpi.2023.100314)  provides classification of pathogenic fungi from microscopic images using deep convolutional neural networks (CNN).
